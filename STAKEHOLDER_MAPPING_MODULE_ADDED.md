## Integration with Existing Modules

### Updated Module Order:
1. Module 1: Core Learning (BA Fundamentals)
2. Module 2: Project Initiation
3. **Module 3: Stakeholder Mapping** ← NEW
4. Module 4: Requirements Elicitation
5. Module 5: Process Mapping
6. Module 6: Requirements Engineering
7. Module 7: Solution Options
8. Module 8: Documentation
9. Module 9: Design
10. Module 10: MVP
11. Module 11: Agile/Scrum

### Why This Position?
The Stakeholder Mapping module is strategically placed **after Project Initiation** because:
- Students have learned what a BA does and how projects start
- They understand the project context from initial documents
- **Before gathering requirements**, they need to know WHO to talk to
- This follows the real-world BA workflow: understand the project → identify stakeholders → gather requirements
