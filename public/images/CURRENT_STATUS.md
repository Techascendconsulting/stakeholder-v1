## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **If you have individual participant photos:**
   - Add them to `public/images/participants/`
   - Use the naming convention: `firstname-lastname.jpg`

2. **If you have screenshots with multiple people:**
   - Extract individual photos from the screenshots
   - Crop each person's photo to a square format
   - Save them with the correct names in `participants/` folder

3. **If you need sample participants:**
   - The system will show colored initials as fallback
   - This looks good but photos are better!

## 🔄 Current Behavior
- **With photos:** Shows actual participant photos in circular avatars
- **Without photos:** Shows colored initials (Yellow, Gray, Gray, Red)
- **Failed photos:** Automatically falls back to initials

The UI enhancement is ready - just add the participant photos!
