# Chapter 18: AI in Business Analysis (Practical, Not Hype)

Artificial Intelligence has moved from the edges of technology into the heart of how organisations operate. Recommendation engines drive retail sales. Predictive models shape credit decisions. Chatbots answer service queries before a human agent ever gets involved. Generative AI tools draft documents, summarise legal contracts, and even sketch designs. For some, AI is a revolution; for others, it is a threat. For the Business Analyst, it is both an opportunity and a responsibility.

Business Analysis has always been about bridging human intent with system capability. AI does not remove that need — it amplifies it. The BA's role is not to become a data scientist, nor to write machine-learning models. It is to ask the right questions, interpret outputs, challenge assumptions, and ensure that AI is used responsibly to deliver value. If requirements were once about features and processes, today they are increasingly about what the AI should do, what guardrails must be in place, and how success will be measured.

This chapter explores AI in the BA context: what it means, how it supports core activities, what new challenges it introduces, and why the analyst's ethical and professional lens is more crucial than ever.

## AI as an Extension of BA Capabilities

AI should be understood not as a replacement for the Business Analyst, but as an extension of their toolkit. In practice, AI can automate time-consuming tasks that once drained analyst hours — note-taking, transcription, initial drafting of requirements, clustering large volumes of customer feedback. By doing so, it frees the BA to focus on the deeper work of interpretation and decision-making.

Consider a regulatory project with hundreds of pages of policy documentation. Traditionally, the BA would spend days reading, annotating, and extracting requirements. With AI summarisation tools, key clauses can be highlighted in minutes. But the AI cannot decide which clauses carry regulatory weight, which conflict with existing processes, or which require escalation. That judgment belongs to the BA. AI accelerates the groundwork; the analyst still provides meaning.

The same applies to customer insights. A retail bank might have thousands of survey responses complaining about the mobile app. AI can group these into themes: login problems, transaction errors, navigation issues. Yet only the BA, in dialogue with stakeholders, can decide whether login problems are the top priority because they drive customer churn, or whether transaction errors pose greater regulatory risk. AI shows patterns; the BA links those patterns to value.

The critical shift is this: AI moves the BA away from clerical burden and toward sense-making. Analysts who embrace it will find themselves working at a more strategic level, ensuring that insight translates into action.

## AI in Requirements and Delivery

One of the most hyped uses of AI is in drafting user stories, acceptance criteria, or even test cases. Generative AI tools can take a stakeholder statement — "We want customers to reset their passwords" — and instantly generate scenarios: "Given a customer forgets their password… When they request a reset link… Then the system sends an email valid for 15 minutes."

This speed is impressive, but it is not enough. Left unchallenged, AI-generated requirements may be too generic, omit critical edge cases, or reflect patterns from training data that do not match the organisation's needs. The BA's job is to treat AI as a co-pilot, not a replacement. The draft is a starting point. The value lies in reviewing it with stakeholders, asking: Does this reflect our risk appetite? What happens if the link is clicked twice? What is the escalation process if email fails?

The same dynamic plays out in delivery. Test teams now use AI to generate regression test suites from requirements. Developers experiment with AI pair-programming tools. Here too, the BA ensures that what is being built and tested reflects true business intent. AI accelerates artefacts; the BA safeguards value.

### Extended Case Example: Digital Onboarding in Finance
A fintech firm introduced AI-driven identity verification to speed up customer onboarding. The AI automatically matched selfies against ID documents. On paper, the requirement was simple: "Verify identity using AI." In practice, the BA uncovered critical gaps. What if the AI misclassifies? What appeal process exists? How will errors be logged? What about customers with accessibility needs who struggle with selfies? By probing these questions, the BA turned a vague "use AI" requirement into a robust design balancing automation with manual fallback.

AI accelerated delivery, but without BA intervention, it could have delivered exclusion and reputational risk.

## New Challenges AI Introduces

If AI accelerates the BA's work, it also introduces new layers of complexity.

First, there is the issue of explainability. Stakeholders are unlikely to accept "the AI says so" as justification for critical decisions. A BA must capture requirements for transparency: How should the AI explain its decisions? What evidence should be visible to end users? In financial services, this can mean surfacing why a loan application was declined. In healthcare, it can mean showing which symptoms triggered an alert.

Second, there is the problem of bias. AI models learn from historical data. If that data is biased, the outputs will be biased. The BA must ask: Where does the training data come from? Does it reflect the population we serve? How will we test for unfairness? These questions are not technical luxuries; they are business-critical safeguards.

Third, AI raises governance questions. Who owns the AI's decisions? If a chatbot gives incorrect financial advice, is the business liable? If an AI model drifts over time, who monitors performance? The BA must capture these governance requirements as rigorously as they would functional requirements.

### Extended Case Example: Recruitment Screening Tool
A recruitment firm sought to use AI to shortlist candidates. The model flagged "best-fit" applicants based on CVs. Early results seemed promising. But the BA asked: How is 'best-fit' defined? What data is being used? Analysis revealed that the AI heavily weighted past hiring decisions, which were themselves biased. Without intervention, the AI would have institutionalised discrimination. By surfacing the ethical and governance risks, the BA ensured fairness controls were implemented.

The lesson is clear: the BA's role is not just to harness AI, but to protect the organisation from its blind spots.

## The Ethical and Professional Dimension

Perhaps the greatest challenge AI poses is ethical. Just because something is technically possible does not mean it should be done. Collecting more customer data, nudging behaviour, automating sensitive decisions — all may be feasible. But are they right?

The BA must be the voice that asks: Are we respecting consent? Are we transparent about how customer data is used? Are we designing inclusively? These are not abstract questions. They define whether AI enhances trust or erodes it.

Professionalism here means courage: raising ethical concerns even when business pressure demands speed. It means helping stakeholders see the reputational risks of short-term choices. It means balancing neutrality with advocacy, ensuring AI is deployed responsibly.

## Conclusion: The BA as AI Navigator

AI will not eliminate the role of the Business Analyst. It will elevate it — if the BA chooses to adapt. Analysts who cling to clerical tasks risk being replaced. Analysts who embrace AI as a co-pilot will find their influence growing.

The BA of the AI era is not a coder but a navigator:

Navigating ambiguity between what AI promises and what it actually delivers.

Navigating ethics between what is legal and what is fair.

Navigating business priorities between efficiency and trust.

AI accelerates output. The BA ensures outcomes.

In that sense, AI does not diminish the Business Analyst. It makes the role more essential than ever — the human bridge between intelligence that is artificial and value that must remain profoundly human.
