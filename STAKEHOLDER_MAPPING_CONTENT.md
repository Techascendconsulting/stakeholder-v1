# Improved Stakeholder Mapping Content - Narrative Style

## Lesson 1: Who Are Stakeholders?

After joining a project and reviewing the initial documents, you might think you're ready to start gathering requirements. But there's a critical step first: understanding who your stakeholders are.

### The £2 Million Mistake

Let me tell you about Sarah, a junior BA who learned this lesson the hard way. She was assigned to improve an online booking system for a hotel chain. The project sponsor told her the goal was simple: "make bookings faster." Sarah spent six weeks working with the IT team, designed a streamlined booking flow, and proudly presented it to management.

The response? Silence. Then the complaints started.

The customer service team was furious. Sarah's "streamlined" system had removed the ability to modify bookings—a feature they used hundreds of times daily to handle customer changes. The marketing team was equally upset. The new system no longer captured the booking data they needed for their campaigns. And the finance team? They discovered too late that the payment processing no longer integrated properly with their accounting software.

The project was scrapped. £2 million wasted. All because Sarah had only spoken to two groups of people: the project sponsor and the IT team. She had forgotten to identify all her stakeholders.

### What Is a Stakeholder?

A stakeholder is anyone who has a stake in what you're about to build. They're the people who will be affected by the changes, the decision-makers who can approve or block your work, and the experts who hold the information you desperately need to understand the problem. Think of them as the invisible architects of your project's success or failure.

Here's a better way to think about it. Imagine you're remodeling a house. The obvious stakeholders are the homeowners—they're paying for it and will live there. But what about the neighbors who'll endure months of noise? The planning authority who must approve the work? The utility companies whose pipes and cables run under the property? The future buyers who might value (or hate) your design choices?

Missing any of these stakeholders could derail your project. The planning authority could halt construction. The utility company could discover you've violated regulations. The neighbors could file noise complaints. Each stakeholder holds a piece of the puzzle, and as a Business Analyst, your first job is to find all the pieces.

### A Real Project: The Warehouse Management System

Let me walk you through a real example. You've been assigned to implement a new warehouse management system for a logistics company. On day one, the project sponsor tells you: "We need to track inventory better and reduce picking errors."

Your first instinct might be to start talking to the warehouse manager and the IT team. That's a start, but it's nowhere near enough.

Let's think about who else is involved in warehouse operations. When a product arrives, who receives it? The receiving team. Who puts it away? The put-away team. Who picks items when orders come in? The picking team. Who handles discrepancies when the wrong items are sent? The customer service team. Who approves purchase orders? The procurement team. Who reconciles inventory numbers at month-end? The finance team. Who maintains the current warehouse system? The IT operations team. And who actually pays for all of this? The CFO.

That's at least nine different stakeholder groups—and we haven't even mentioned external stakeholders like suppliers, delivery drivers, or regulatory bodies who might require specific record-keeping.

If you only speak to the warehouse manager, you'll build a system that works for management but frustrates the people who actually use it every day. If you ignore finance, you might design something they can't reconcile with accounting systems. If you skip IT operations, you'll deploy a system they can't support.

### How to Find Your Stakeholders

When you first join a project, start by reviewing every document you've been given. The project brief, the business case, the org charts—they all contain clues. Every time you see a name, a role, or a department mentioned, write it down. That's your starting list.

Then speak to your project sponsor or manager. Ask them: "Who else should I be talking to?" This simple question often reveals stakeholders who weren't obvious from the documents. The sponsor might mention that Legal needs to approve data handling, or that an external vendor provides the current system.

But don't stop there. As you speak to each stakeholder, ask them the same question: "Who else is affected by this?" The warehouse manager might mention that the dispatch team relies on inventory data. The dispatch team might reveal that delivery drivers need real-time stock visibility. Each conversation reveals more stakeholders, like pulling a thread that unravels a hidden network of connections.

This is how you build a comprehensive stakeholder register—a living document that grows as you discover more about the project. At this stage, it's better to include too many stakeholders than to miss a critical one. You can always adjust your engagement strategy later, but you can't easily recover from ignoring someone who needed to be involved.

### What Happens When You Miss Stakeholders

I once worked with a BA named Marcus who was implementing a new expense management system. He spoke to Finance (who requested it), IT (who would build it), and a few managers (who would approve expenses). The system launched on schedule and under budget. Success, right?

Wrong.

Within days, complaints flooded in. Employees couldn't submit expenses from their phones—Marcus had only tested desktop workflows. International employees couldn't submit foreign currency expenses—Marcus had only considered UK operations. Contractors and freelancers couldn't access the system at all—Marcus had assumed only full-time employees would use it.

The system had to be rebuilt. The project timeline doubled. Employee satisfaction plummeted. All because Marcus had failed to identify three critical stakeholder groups: mobile users, international employees, and external contractors.

Missing a stakeholder doesn't just mean missing their requirements. It means missing their perspective, their constraints, and their ability to champion (or sabotage) your project. A Legal team member you didn't consult can halt your project at the last minute for compliance violations. End users you didn't involve can resist adoption and make your project fail despite being technically correct.

### Your Task

At this stage of the project, your goal is to create a master list of everyone who has a stake in the outcome. Don't worry about how you'll engage them yet—that comes later. For now, focus on building the most complete picture possible of who matters to this project and why.

Start with the obvious stakeholders: the project sponsor, the people who requested the change, and the teams who will use the solution. Then expand outward. Who supports those teams? Who approves their budgets? Who relies on the data they produce? Who regulates their industry?

This detective work—asking questions, reading documents, mapping connections—is the foundation of successful stakeholder management. Get it right, and you'll gather requirements from all the right people. Get it wrong, and you'll build something nobody wanted, solving problems nobody had.

Next, once you know who your stakeholders are, you need to understand how much attention each one deserves. That's where stakeholder analysis comes in.
