# ChatGPT Request: Professional Process Mapper Implementation

I need you to implement a production-ready Process Mapper component for a React + TypeScript + Tailwind application. The current implementation has multiple issues and needs to be completely rewritten with proper UX/UI principles.

## Current Issues:
1. Duplicate project headers and back buttons
2. New diagram creation not working properly
3. Confusing "Open" dropdown that serves no purpose
4. Poor state management causing diagrams to revert
5. Basic UX patterns not following Silicon Valley standards

## Requirements:
1. **Clean, single header** with project name and back button
2. **Smart diagram tabs** - show first 5, then "View All" for many diagrams
3. **Proper new diagram creation** - fresh canvas, no reverting
4. **Professional diagram manager modal** for handling many diagrams
5. **Clean state management** - no unnecessary re-renders or state conflicts
6. **Modern UX patterns** - intuitive, no confusion

## Tech Stack:
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- BPMN.js for diagram editing
- Supabase for storage

## Expected Behavior:
- Create new diagram → shows fresh canvas immediately
- Switch between diagrams → seamless, no data loss
- Many diagrams → smart organization with View All
- Professional, polished interface

Please provide a complete, working implementation that follows modern UX/UI best practices. No half-solutions or multiple corrections needed.
