# Chapter 13: The BA in Scrum Events

Agile delivery has changed how projects are run, but it has not changed the fact that clarity, alignment, and value are hard to achieve. Scrum provides a structure, but it does not prescribe who should create requirements, who should probe for assumptions, or who ensures that stakeholders intent is properly understood. This is where the Business Analyst proves indispensable.

Some organisations ask whether BAs are even needed in Scrum. The Scrum Guide does not mention them. But in practice, where Scrum teams succeed, you almost always find someone performing the analytical duties of a BA: preparing backlog items, clarifying acceptance criteria, engaging stakeholders, and facilitating learning. Without that presence, teams risk moving fast but in the wrong direction. With it, Scrum events are sharper, decisions clearer, and delivery more aligned with value.

This chapter explores each Scrum event and shows how the BA contributes — not by owning the event, but by enhancing it.

## Sprint Planning: Turning Ambition into Commitment

Sprint Planning is the gateway to each iteration. The team comes together with the Product Owner to decide what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint. On paper, it sounds simple. In reality, Sprint Planning can be a messy conversation filled with vague items, half-baked assumptions, and over-optimistic commitments.

The BAs role in Sprint Planning is to bring clarity and grounding. Ahead of the session, the BA works with stakeholders and the Product Owner to refine backlog items. They ensure that each story has been discussed, that acceptance criteria are explicit, and that dependencies have been identified. During the meeting, the BA supports the team in asking the right questions: "What exactly does this story involve?" "Do we understand the rules behind this?" "Are we sure this can be delivered in two weeks?"

Without a BA, Sprint Planning often degenerates into guesswork. With a BA, it becomes a meaningful act of commitment.

### Case Example: Digital Insurance Platform
In one project, Sprint Planning was a recurring nightmare. Stories were pulled into the sprint without being fully understood. Midway through, developers would discover hidden complexity. Stories spilled over sprint after sprint. Morale dropped.

A BA stepped in to improve preparation. They held quick pre-planning conversations with stakeholders, clarified business rules, and gathered examples. They also facilitated backlog refinement sessions so the team entered Sprint Planning with stories ready to commit. Within two sprints, the difference was stark. The team stopped rolling stories over and began finishing what they started. Sprint Planning shifted from chaos to confidence.

## Daily Scrum: Spotting the Hidden Blockers

The Daily Scrum is the heartbeat of the team. It is where members share progress and surface impediments. Officially, the BA is not a required participant. In practice, their presence often makes the difference between blockers lingering and blockers being resolved.

Developers and testers usually highlight technical obstacles: "I cannot finish this until the API is fixed." But often the real blockers are analytical. A developer says, "I do not know how refunds should work." A tester says, "I am not sure what the acceptance criteria mean for this edge case." These are not coding problems — they are clarity problems.

The BA listens for these signals. They may not speak much during the stand-up, but they take away action items: clarifying requirements, confirming rules with stakeholders, or updating acceptance criteria. By doing so, they keep delivery flowing.

### Case Example: Retail Loyalty Programme
On a retail project, a developer reported in the Daily Scrum that they were "blocked on the discount rules." The issue sounded small, so the team moved on. But the BA stopped and dug deeper after the stand-up. What emerged was that the entire loyalty system had ambiguous rules: should discounts stack, should expired vouchers still apply, what about staff purchases?

The BA quickly organised a call with the business team, clarified the rules, and updated the backlog items. What could have been a week of wasted development became a one-day adjustment. The BAs ability to spot and resolve hidden blockers in Daily Scrums saved the sprint.

## Sprint Review: Turning Demonstrations into Dialogue

The Sprint Review is intended to be a collaborative session where the team shows progress and stakeholders provide feedback. Too often, it devolves into a presentation: developers demonstrate screens, stakeholders nod politely, and nothing changes.

The BA can transform the Sprint Review into a true feedback loop. They prepare stakeholders beforehand by ensuring they know what to expect. They frame the session not as "Here is what we built" but as "Here is what we built, here is what we learned, and here is what we need you to confirm." They ask probing questions that uncover hidden needs: "Does this meet compliance standards?" "Would this process work during peak season?" They also capture stakeholder comments and translate them into backlog items without losing intent.

### Case Example: Retail Checkout Flow
A team proudly presented a new online checkout at a Sprint Review. Stakeholders seemed happy until the BA asked: "Would this flow pass our age verification checks for restricted products?" The question sparked a deeper discussion. It turned out compliance rules had been overlooked. Without that intervention, the system would have launched with a regulatory gap.

The BAs presence ensured the Sprint Review was not just a demo but a moment of alignment. Stakeholders left engaged, and the backlog was adjusted with vital new work.

## Sprint Retrospective: Seeing What Others Miss

The Retrospective is a chance for the Scrum Team to reflect on how they work together. While BAs are not mandatory participants, their perspective can be invaluable. Developers and testers naturally focus on technical and workflow issues. The BA, however, often notices patterns others miss: recurring requirement misunderstandings, stakeholder availability gaps, or communication breakdowns between business and IT.

By raising these observations, the BA helps the team improve not only how they code, but how they collaborate. They may highlight that stories are consistently under-refined before being pulled in, or that testers are excluded from early discussions. These are not technical issues but process ones — and they are exactly the kind of systemic blockers BAs are trained to see.

### Case Example: Healthcare System Rollout
In a healthcare project, the Retrospectives focused heavily on technical issues: testing environments, deployment pipelines. The BA observed a different problem: clinicians who were supposed to provide input were rarely available. As a result, stories were written based on assumptions. By raising this in the Retrospective, the team agreed to schedule regular stakeholder workshops mid-sprint. The result was fewer misunderstandings and faster delivery.

The BAs contribution in Retrospectives is subtle but powerful: they remind the team that success is not only about working code, but about working relationships and alignment with business reality.

## Backlog Refinement: The Quiet Backbone

Backlog Refinement is not an official Scrum event, but it is where much of the BAs craft lives. Stories do not emerge ready to deliver. They must be discussed, clarified, split, and prioritised. Refinement sessions are often messy, with stakeholders pushing for detail and developers resisting over-specification. The BA sits in the middle, translating business needs into language the team can build.

Here, the BA ensures that epics are broken into manageable stories, that acceptance criteria are added, and that priorities align with value. They also identify dependencies early, preventing nasty surprises mid-sprint. Backlog Refinement is where the BA protects the team from chaos.

### Case Example: Airline Booking System
An airline project had hundreds of backlog items, many of them vague: "Handle cancellations," "Support multiple passengers," "Add loyalty features." Developers were overwhelmed. The BA led structured refinement sessions. They split "Handle cancellations" into specific stories: cancellation by customer, cancellation by airline, partial refunds, voucher credit. Each was accompanied by acceptance criteria. Suddenly, what had been unworkable became actionable.

This is the BAs strength: turning backlog clutter into deliverable work. Without it, teams drown in ambiguity. With it, they build iteratively with confidence.

## Conclusion

Scrum does not mention Business Analysts, but real Scrum teams thrive when someone plays the analytical role. In Sprint Planning, the BA turns ambition into commitment. In Daily Scrums, they spot hidden blockers. In Sprint Reviews, they turn demos into dialogue. In Retrospectives, they surface systemic issues. And in Backlog Refinement, they transform vague backlog items into deliverable work.

The BA does not own these events. They enhance them. Their presence ensures that clarity, alignment, and value remain at the centre of Agile delivery. In a world where Scrum risks becoming a series of rituals, the BA ensures those rituals serve their true purpose: delivering outcomes that matter.
