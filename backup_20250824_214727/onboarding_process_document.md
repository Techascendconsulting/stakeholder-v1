# Customer Onboarding Process Optimization - Current Process Document

## Project Overview
**Company:** TechCorp Solutions  
**Project:** Customer Onboarding Process Optimization  
**Current Timeline:** 6-8 weeks  
**Target Timeline:** 3-4 weeks  
**Current Churn Rate:** 23%  
**Target Churn Reduction:** 40%

## Current 10-Step Onboarding Process

### Step 1: Sales Deal Closure
- **Action:** Sales team closes deal in Salesforce
- **Duration:** 1-2 days
- **Issues:** No automated handoff to next step

### Step 2: Manual Email Handoff
- **Action:** Manual email notification to Implementation team
- **Duration:** 24-48 hours delay
- **Issues:** Inconsistent information transfer, delays

### Step 3: Kickoff Call Scheduling
- **Action:** Implementation team schedules kickoff call with customer and key stakeholders
- **Who:** Implementation Manager (Sarah), Customer Project Manager, Sales Rep, IT Lead
- **Duration:** 3-5 business days to arrange
- **Real Challenges:** 
  - Customer availability conflicts with internal team schedules
  - Sales rep often unavailable due to travel/meetings
  - IT Lead has limited availability (only Tues/Thurs)
  - Customer timezone differences cause scheduling headaches
  - No automated scheduling system - all done via email chains

### Step 4: Data Entry
- **Action:** Implementation team manually enters customer data into Monday.com
- **Who:** Implementation Coordinator (Mike), Implementation Manager (Sarah)
- **Duration:** 1-2 days
- **Real Challenges:**
  - Duplicate data entry across 4 different systems
  - Customer information often incomplete from Sales
  - Monday.com fields don't match Salesforce data structure
  - Manual copying leads to typos and missing information
  - No validation - errors only discovered later in the process

### Step 5: Parallel Technical Setup
- **Action:** IT, Product, and Support teams work independently on their respective tasks
- **Who:** IT Lead (David), Product Manager (Alex), Support Lead (Lisa)
- **Duration:** 5-7 days
- **Real Challenges:**
  - Teams work in silos with no visibility into each other's progress
  - IT needs customer network info that Product doesn't have
  - Support creates training materials before Product finishes configuration
  - No shared timeline - teams don't know when others will be ready
  - Customer gets conflicting information from different teams
  - No escalation path when teams are blocked

### Step 6: Independent Stakeholder Calls
- **Action:** Each team schedules separate calls with customer to discuss their specific requirements
- **Who:** IT Lead (David), Product Manager (Alex), Support Lead (Lisa), Customer Success Manager (James)
- **Duration:** 3-5 days
- **Real Challenges:**
  - Customer gets 4-5 separate calls in one week - very frustrating
  - Each team asks for the same information but in different formats
  - Customer has to repeat their requirements multiple times
  - No shared notes - each team starts from scratch
  - Customer feels like no one is coordinating their experience
  - Teams don't know what other teams have already discussed

### Step 7: Staging Configuration
- **Action:** Technical setup and testing in staging environment
- **Who:** IT Lead (David), Product Manager (Alex), QA Engineer (Tom)
- **Duration:** 2-3 days
- **Real Challenges:**
  - Staging environment often unavailable due to other projects
  - No automated testing - everything done manually
  - Customer can't access staging until IT finishes setup
  - No clear handoff between IT setup and Product configuration
  - QA testing happens in isolation - customer feedback comes later
  - Staging environment doesn't match production exactly

### Step 8: UAT Testing
- **Action:** User Acceptance Testing coordinated via email
- **Who:** Customer Project Manager, IT Lead (David), Product Manager (Alex)
- **Duration:** 3-5 days
- **Real Challenges:**
  - Customer doesn't know what to test or how to test it
  - No structured test plan - just "try it out"
  - Feedback comes via email - hard to track and prioritize
  - Customer finds issues that should have been caught earlier
  - No clear process for fixing issues found during UAT
  - Customer gets frustrated with unclear testing requirements

### Step 9: Go-Live Scheduling
- **Action:** Final go-live coordination and launch
- **Who:** Implementation Manager (Sarah), IT Lead (David), Customer Project Manager
- **Duration:** 2-3 days
- **Real Challenges:**
  - Go-live requires coordination across 4 different systems
  - Customer often not available on scheduled go-live date
  - No rollback plan if something goes wrong
  - IT needs to be available for immediate support during go-live
  - Customer success metrics aren't clearly defined
  - No automated monitoring - everything checked manually

### Step 10: Customer Success Handoff
- **Action:** Handoff to Customer Success team for ongoing support
- **Who:** Implementation Manager (Sarah), Customer Success Manager (James)
- **Duration:** 1-2 days
- **Real Challenges:**
  - Customer Success team doesn't have complete context from implementation
  - No standardized handoff document - information varies by project
  - Customer expectations set during implementation don't match reality
  - Customer Success team has to rebuild relationship from scratch
  - No clear escalation path for post-implementation issues
  - Customer feels abandoned after implementation team moves on
