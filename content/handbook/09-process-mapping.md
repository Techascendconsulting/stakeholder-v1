# Chapter 9: Process Mapping — Making Work Visible

In every organisation, people describe their processes differently. Executives speak in abstractions, managers describe the official policy, and frontline staff quietly explain the shortcuts that make things work. Each story is partly true, yet none shows the full picture.

That's why process mapping is one of the most fundamental disciplines in Business Analysis. It cuts through words and replaces them with evidence. A process map doesn't just explain how work is done — it shows it. It turns invisible routines into visible flows.

A well-constructed map answers questions before they're asked: Where are the bottlenecks? Who is really doing the work? Where are decisions slowing things down? Which steps add no value? It removes guesswork and puts fact on the table.

Process mapping is not optional, not occasional, not a "nice-to-have." It is the BA's lens through which inefficiencies are revealed, requirements are grounded, and improvements are designed.

## As-Is Mapping: Seeing the Current State

An as-is process map shows how work is performed today. It is descriptive, not prescriptive. It captures reality — including inefficiencies, delays, and the workarounds staff invent to survive broken processes.

### Why As-Is Maps Matter

**Expose the truth.** Everyone has a different version of the process in their head. An as-is map makes the reality visible.

**Provide a baseline.** Without the current state, you can't measure the impact of change.

**Surface inefficiencies.** Bottlenecks and duplications stand out when seen in sequence.

**Build trust.** Staff feel validated when their actual work — not the official manual — is captured.

### How As-Is Maps Are Built

**Define scope.** Set boundaries for the process: where it starts, where it ends.

**Gather input.** Use interviews, workshops, and shadowing to capture real steps.

**Include exceptions.** Don't ignore the detours and workarounds; they are often where the real pain lies.

**Draw clearly.** Use flowcharts or swimlanes to represent steps and handoffs.

**Validate.** Review with stakeholders until everyone agrees: "Yes, this is how it works today."

### Case Example: Hospital Billing

In a hospital, late billing was blamed on "slow IT systems." The BA mapped the as-is process by shadowing finance staff and facilitating workshops. The map revealed 12 steps, including four manual approvals that added no value. Staff admitted they often held invoices until they had a stack to process, adding several days of delay.

When the map was presented, the conversation changed instantly. IT was no longer blamed. Everyone could see the real cause: inefficient approvals and batching habits. The as-is map cut through opinion and revealed truth.

## To-Be Mapping: Designing the Future

Once the current state is visible, the BA helps design the to-be process — a streamlined future state that removes inefficiencies and introduces improvements.

### Why To-Be Maps Matter

**Turn goals into design.** Abstract phrases like "streamline" or "digitise" become concrete flows.

**Align stakeholders.** Everyone can point at the same diagram of the future and agree on what change means.

**Guide delivery.** Developers, trainers, and change managers use the to-be map as a blueprint.

**Demonstrate value.** Comparing as-is and to-be makes benefits measurable.

### How To-Be Maps Are Built

**Start with the as-is map as the baseline.**

**In workshops, challenge each step:** Does this add value? Could it be automated or removed?

**Introduce improvements** such as automation, role changes, or simplified rules.

**Validate feasibility** with both technical and business teams.

**Produce a clear diagram** showing the streamlined process.

### Case Example: Insurance Claims

An insurer's as-is claims process involved 14 steps across departments. In a to-be workshop, the BA asked: "Why do we need this step?" One by one, duplications and redundancies were stripped out. Approvals were consolidated, and automated checks replaced manual ones.

The final to-be map had 7 steps. Claims resolution time dropped from 12 days to 5. Customers saw faster payouts, and the business reduced cost per claim. The to-be map wasn't an abstract vision; it became the operational design for the new process.

## Flowcharts and Swimlanes: Tools of Clarity

The most common way to represent processes is with flowcharts. These diagrams use simple symbols — rectangles for tasks, diamonds for decisions, arrows for flow. Anyone can read them.

For cross-department processes, swimlanes are even more powerful. By dividing the map into lanes for each role or department, swimlanes reveal handoffs and dependencies.

### Case Example: Retail Returns

A retailer faced endless complaints about product returns. The BA created a swimlane diagram showing the process across five departments: store staff, warehouse, finance, logistics, and customer service.

The picture was damning. Each return bounced across all five teams, often duplicating checks. Customers waited weeks for refunds.

The swimlane map made the complexity undeniable. Leaders who thought the process was "fine" saw the waste in black and white. By redesigning to cut handoffs, refund times were reduced by 60%.

## Process Mapping Is Not Optional

Unlike other elicitation or analysis techniques, process mapping is not situational. You don't map "when needed." You map because it is always needed.

Why? Because organisations constantly overestimate how well they understand their processes. Executives make assumptions, staff adapt in silence, and systems evolve in ways no one documents. Without process mapping, inefficiencies remain invisible, and projects chase the wrong problems.

### Case Example: Government Licensing
In a government licensing project, officials argued endlessly about whether delays were due to staff performance or outdated software. The BA insisted on mapping the as-is process. The diagram revealed 22 steps, 8 of which were redundant approvals no one had mentioned. The map cut through the argument: the real cause was bureaucracy, not staff or IT.

Process mapping isn't an add-on. It is the foundation of Business Analysis.

## Benefits of Process Mapping

**Clarity.** Everyone sees the same truth.

**Alignment.** Stakeholders move from arguing opinions to solving problems.

**Evidence.** Justifies investment by showing exactly where inefficiencies lie.

**Improvement.** Provides a baseline (as-is) and a design target (to-be).

**Training and compliance.** Serves as reference material for onboarding and audits.

## Pitfalls of Process Mapping

**Overcomplication.** A BA who tries to capture every micro-exception creates unreadable maps.

**Oversimplification.** High-level diagrams that hide pain points defeat the purpose.

**Not validated.** Maps drawn in isolation reflect assumptions, not reality.

**Stale artefacts.** Outdated maps lose credibility and are ignored.

### Case Example: Manufacturing Overkill

In one manufacturing project, a BA created an as-is process map that attempted to cover every variation. The diagram spanned 12 pages, overwhelming stakeholders. Instead of clarity, it created confusion. The lesson: a process map should be as detailed as necessary, but as simple as possible.

## Conclusion

Process mapping is not about producing a diagram. It is about producing clarity. The as-is map exposes the truth of how work is currently done. The to-be map creates a shared design for the future. Flowcharts and swimlanes turn complexity into something stakeholders can see and act on.

Unlike other techniques, process mapping is not a tool you pull out occasionally. It is the BA's constant companion — the foundation of analysis, improvement, and alignment.

With process maps, organisations stop arguing about who is at fault and start seeing where change must happen. They stop imagining processes and start confronting reality. For a Business Analyst, there are few tools more powerful.
