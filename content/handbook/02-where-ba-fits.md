# Chapter 2: Where the BA Fits (SDLC, Agile, Waterfall, Hybrid)

When people first hear about Business Analysts, they often struggle to picture where the role sits in the bigger machinery of change. Some imagine the BA as someone who collects notes at the beginning of a project and then disappears. Others think of them as permanent fixtures in Agile ceremonies. In truth, the answer depends on how the organisation delivers projects. To understand this, we must zoom out and look at the life cycle of systems and solutions.

## The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the classic framework for describing how ideas turn into working products. Even if you never use that name in the workplace, the stages are familiar. Every new system begins with planning. Someone identifies a need, explores whether the idea makes sense, and decides whether to fund it. From there, the work moves into analysis, where the details are explored. Who will use this system? What problems will it solve? What outcomes do we want to see? The design phase then translates those needs into blueprints — diagrams, models, and workflows that explain how the system will function. Development follows, where the system is built or configured. Testing ensures that the solution works as intended, and finally, deployment makes it live. Even after launch, maintenance continues, because no system is ever truly finished.

For a Business Analyst, the SDLC is not just a technical process — it is a map of where their skills are applied. In planning, the BA sharpens the problem statement, making sure the organisation understands the "why" before it invests in the "what." In analysis, they work closely with stakeholders to uncover real needs, separating wish lists from genuine requirements. During design, the BA checks that proposed solutions still tie back to those needs, translating between business language and technical decisions. Development may look like the domain of coders, but BAs remain present, answering questions and clarifying assumptions so that the team doesn't drift away from the original goals. In testing, BAs help ensure that acceptance criteria reflect the business view of success. And even in deployment, the BA gathers feedback and helps measure whether the promised value is being delivered.

## The Waterfall Approach

It is tempting to think of the SDLC as a neat sequence, but in practice, different organisations apply it in different ways. The most traditional is the Waterfall approach, where phases are completed one after another in a straight line. Waterfall assumes that once requirements are captured, they remain stable. This makes the BA's role in the early stages absolutely critical. Months may be spent interviewing stakeholders, producing large documents, and chasing signatures, because once the project moves forward, change is expensive.

This approach has strengths — clarity, structure, and accountability. But it also carries risks. One European government agency discovered this when it spent nearly a year documenting requirements for a benefits system, only for legislation to change before development began. Because Waterfall locks phases in order, the project had to redo months of work, losing both time and money. For BAs, the lesson is clear: Waterfall demands precision, but it also requires awareness that no requirement lives in a vacuum.

## The Agile Approach

Agile methods arose in response to exactly those frustrations. Instead of treating the SDLC as a single long sequence, Agile treats it as a series of short cycles. Each cycle, or Sprint, touches on planning, analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment in miniature. Teams deliver small increments of value every few weeks, and the BA is embedded throughout the process. Their role shifts from producing thick binders of requirements to being a constant collaborator — refining the backlog, breaking down large goals into manageable user stories, clarifying acceptance criteria, and ensuring that what is delivered ties back to the intended value.

One telecom provider provides a good illustration of this. Under its old Waterfall system, BAs routinely wrote 200-page specification documents that often sat on shelves while projects ran late. After adopting Scrum, the same BAs facilitated weekly refinement workshops instead. Rather than defining everything up front, they worked with stakeholders and developers to prioritise and slice work into user stories. Within three months, customers were already using new features. For the BA, the skill here was not about documenting more but about enabling clarity and alignment in real time.

## The Hybrid Approach

In reality, most organisations today do not live fully in Waterfall or fully in Agile. Instead, they operate in Hybrid models. A bank facing regulatory requirements, for example, may need BAs to produce formal requirement documents that can stand up to audits. At the same time, its delivery teams may be running in Agile Sprints, expecting stories and acceptance criteria on a rolling basis. For the BA, this means switching hats. One moment, you are drafting a structured requirements catalogue for compliance. The next, you are collaborating with developers to refine a backlog item. Hybrid environments are demanding, but they are also where BAs prove their adaptability.

## The Common Thread: Adaptability

This adaptability is the common thread across all approaches. The BA's purpose — to ensure the right problem is solved and value is delivered — never changes. What does change is the rhythm of the work and the tools used to achieve it. In Waterfall, your clarity comes through documentation. In Agile, your clarity comes through conversation and iteration. In Hybrid, you need both. The best BAs are not those who insist on one way of working but those who flex their approach while keeping their focus steady on value.

## Key Takeaways

Understanding where the BA fits is not about memorising jargon or aligning yourself to a methodology. It is about seeing the bigger picture. The SDLC provides that picture: the life story of any system. Waterfall, Agile, and Hybrid are simply different ways of walking through that story. The BA's role is to be present in each chapter, making sure the plot never drifts away from its purpose.

- The SDLC provides the framework for understanding where BAs add value throughout a project's lifecycle
- Waterfall demands precision in early requirements but carries the risk of inflexibility
- Agile requires constant collaboration and iteration rather than upfront documentation
- Hybrid approaches demand adaptability and the ability to switch between different working styles
- The BA's core purpose remains constant regardless of the delivery approach
