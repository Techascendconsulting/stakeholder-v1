Track conversation context and stage progress.

TRACK:
- topics_covered: string[] (e.g., ["manual data entry", "system fragmentation"])
- pain_points_identified: Array<{area: string, impact: string, emotion: string, layer: number}>
- information_layers_unlocked: number (1-5)
- stage_progress: Object with completion status per stage
- should_transition: boolean

STAGE COMPLETION CRITERIA:
- problem_exploration: Identified 2-3 specific pain points with examples
- as_is: Mapped end-to-end process with systems and handoffs
- to_be: Explored desired improvements and priorities
- wrap_up: Confirmed understanding and next steps
