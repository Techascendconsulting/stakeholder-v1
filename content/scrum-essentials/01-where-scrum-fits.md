When a Business Analyst finishes gathering requirements, that is not the end of the job. It is the beginning of delivery. You have spoken with stakeholders, explored the problems they face, mapped the current "As-Is" process, and imagined the "To-Be" future state. You have written requirements, usually in the form of user stories and acceptance criteria if the organisation uses Agile.

But requirements on paper do not solve business problems. They need to be built into a working product. This is where Scrum comes in.

## The Scrum Approach — Small, Repeatable Cycles

Scrum is a way of turning those requirements into working software **in small, repeatable cycles** called sprints (typically two to four weeks). At the end of every sprint, the team delivers a working slice of the product. Stakeholders see it, try it, and give feedback. The team then adjusts and continues in the next sprint. Instead of waiting months to discover if we built the wrong thing, we learn every few weeks.

## Why Scrum is Used — Risk Reduction and Learning Speed

**Why Scrum is used:** it reduces risk and increases learning speed. Traditional approaches bundle months of work before showing results. Scrum keeps progress visible and feedback continuous. Priorities can change without throwing away an entire plan.

## What This Means for You as a BA — Staying Engaged

**What this means for you as a BA:** Scrum is the environment where your requirements come alive. You don't write stories and step back; you **stay engaged**. You support the Product Owner with clarity and value, you help Developers understand the "why" behind each story, and you work with the Scrum Master when process issues (like unavailable stakeholders) slow requirement work down.

## The Consequences of Poor Scrum Implementation

**If Scrum is ignored or done poorly:** requirements pile up, stakeholders lose confidence, teams build features nobody uses, and rework explodes late in the project. Understanding where Scrum fits in the BA journey is how you ensure the requirements you captured actually solve the problem they were intended to fix.
