Scrum has a simple structure, but it relies on a few essential artefacts to keep everyone aligned. An artefact in Scrum is just a fancy word for the things the team uses to track, manage, and show progress. These artefacts stop the team from working in the dark. They make the work transparent and visible to everyone.

For a BA, artefacts are where your requirements live and breathe. They are the containers for the stories you write, the acceptance criteria you capture, and the increments the team delivers. Without artefacts, your requirements would float around in documents or conversations and easily get lost. With them, everything is in one place, constantly prioritised and regularly delivered.

Scrum defines three key artefacts — the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Increment. In addition, two quality checklists support them: the Definition of Ready and the Definition of Done. Let's go through each one.

## The Product Backlog — The Master List

The Product Backlog is the master list of everything that might be built for the product. It contains every idea, requirement, and improvement request. But it is not just a list of wishes. It is constantly prioritised and refined so that the most valuable items are at the top.

As a BA, this is where your written requirements live once you have drafted them from stakeholder conversations. You capture user stories, add acceptance criteria, and place them into the backlog. The Product Owner manages priority, but you ensure clarity.

**Example:** You write, "As a new customer, I want to upload my ID online so that I can complete onboarding quickly." That story goes into the Product Backlog. The PO decides it is high priority because it reduces drop-offs. Developers later pull it into refinement with you.

## The Sprint Backlog — The Commitment for the Sprint

The Sprint Backlog is a smaller list taken from the Product Backlog. It contains the items the team commits to delivering in the current sprint.

For you as a BA, the Sprint Backlog is the active set of requirements you will be working on with the team that week or fortnight. It tells you what needs immediate clarification and what developers will expect answers for.

**Example:** In Sprint Planning, the team pulls "Online ID upload" from the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog. That means it is now scheduled for delivery. You must be ready to support developers with details about file formats, storage rules, and error messages throughout the sprint.

## The Increment — The Working Product

The Increment is what the team produces at the end of the sprint. It is not a document or a plan — it is working software or a working product slice.

This is where your requirements are tested against reality. Did the delivered increment match the acceptance criteria you wrote? Did it solve the business problem it was intended to address?

**Example:** At the end of the sprint, the increment is a working ID upload feature. You check it: can a customer upload a passport? Is it stored securely? Does the system handle blurry images properly? If yes, the increment is accepted. If not, adjustments go back into the backlog.

## Definition of Ready (DoR) — When a Requirement is Ready to Build

The Definition of Ready is a team checklist that ensures requirements are clear before they go into a sprint. It asks questions like: is there a clear user story? Are acceptance criteria written? Are there no major unknowns? Is the story small enough to be completed in one sprint?

For you as a BA, the DoR is a standard you hold your requirements against. You don't let vague or incomplete stories enter a sprint.

**Example:** If "Online ID upload" has no decision yet on which file formats are allowed, it is not ready. You delay it until the decision is confirmed. This prevents wasted time later.

## Definition of Done (DoD) — When Work is Truly Finished

The Definition of Done is the team's quality checklist. It says what "done" really means. It might include: code written, tests passed, security checks done, documentation updated.

For the BA, the DoD matters because it ensures requirements are not only built but built to a quality standard the business can trust.

**Example:** The ID upload feature is not "done" just because the screen works. It is done when the file is uploaded, stored securely, tested, reviewed, and meets all acceptance criteria. If anything is missing, it is not truly done.

## Bringing the Artefacts Together

Now you can see how artefacts work as the containers for requirements and delivery.

1. The Product Backlog holds every requirement, written and clarified by you, prioritised by the PO.
2. The Sprint Backlog shows what is being worked on right now.
3. The Increment is the proof — the working solution delivered at the end of the sprint.
4. The DoR ensures requirements are ready before work starts.
5. The DoD ensures quality before work is considered finished.

For a BA, these artefacts are not just tools in Scrum. They are the lifeblood of your work. They show where your requirements live, how they move into delivery, and how they are validated in real business terms.
