## Introduction: Why This Chapter Matters

Data is increasingly central to business decision-making and system design. As a BA, you don't need to become a data scientist, but you do need to understand data concepts well enough to gather requirements, communicate with technical teams, and ensure that data-driven solutions meet business needs.

This chapter provides a practical introduction to data concepts for BAs, focusing on what you need to know to be effective in your role without getting lost in technical complexity.

## Understanding Data Concepts

### Data vs. Information
- **Data** - Raw facts, figures, and observations
- **Information** - Data that has been processed, organized, and contextualized
- **Knowledge** - Information that has been analyzed and understood
- **Wisdom** - Knowledge applied to make decisions and take action

### Data Types
- **Structured data** - Organized in rows and columns (databases, spreadsheets)
- **Unstructured data** - Text, images, videos, social media posts
- **Semi-structured data** - JSON, XML, email headers
- **Time series data** - Data points collected over time

### Data Quality
- **Accuracy** - Data is correct and free from errors
- **Completeness** - All required data is present
- **Consistency** - Data is uniform across different sources
- **Timeliness** - Data is current and up-to-date
- **Validity** - Data conforms to defined rules and formats
