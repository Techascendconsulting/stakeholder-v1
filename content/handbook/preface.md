# Preface

When I first began working with aspiring Business Analysts, one thing became clear: there was a gap between what people were taught and what they were expected to do in real projects. Many could recite frameworks, but struggled to run a stakeholder workshop. Others knew Agile terminology, but not how to apply it in daily ceremonies. Some could explain "requirements" in theory, but not write acceptance criteria that guided developers and testers.

This book was written to close that gap.

It is designed as a teaching handbook, not a training script. It combines explanation, examples, diagrams, and "In Practice" exercises to help you move from understanding concepts to applying them with confidence. It is written for:

• Aspiring Business Analysts who want to transition into the role and need a clear, practical guide.  
• Practicing BAs who want to sharpen their skills and adapt to Agile, digital, and AI-driven projects.  
• Agile professionals — Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Project Managers — who want to better understand the BA role and how it contributes to value delivery.

Each chapter can be read on its own, but the book is structured to flow naturally from foundations, to stakeholders, to requirements, to Agile delivery, to data, to the future of BA, and finally to your own career journey. At the end of every chapter, you will find "In Practice" activities — prompts to try out what you've learned. These are your bridge between reading and doing.

Business Analysis is ultimately about value — not documents, not jargon, but solving the right problems in the right way. My hope is that this book equips you to see beyond process into purpose, and to carry the mindset of a true Business Analyst wherever your career takes you.
