# Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to the countless business analysts, product managers, developers, and stakeholders who have shared their experiences, challenges, and insights over the years. This book is a reflection of real-world practice, and it exists because of the community's willingness to share what works—and what doesn't.

Special thanks go to the practitioners who reviewed early drafts, the organizations that allowed me to observe their BA practices, and the students who challenged me to explain complex concepts more clearly. Your feedback has been invaluable in shaping this practical guide.

I am also grateful to the broader business analysis community—from the IIBA to local BA meetups—for creating spaces where we can learn, share, and grow together. The field of business analysis continues to evolve, and it is through this collaborative spirit that we advance the discipline.

Finally, thank you to the readers who will use this book to deliver better value in their organizations. Your success is the ultimate measure of this book's worth.
