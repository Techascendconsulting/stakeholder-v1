# Foreword

Business Analysis is one of the most misunderstood yet vital roles in modern organisations. Too often, projects fail not because of poor technology, but because the problem was never truly understood, stakeholders were misaligned, or requirements lacked clarity. The Business Analyst sits at the heart of these challenges — a translator, a facilitator, and a problem-solver.

Yet, the role has evolved. Today's BA doesn't only write requirements — they shape product thinking, enable Agile delivery, and increasingly use tools like AI and data analysis to bring clarity and speed. Unfortunately, many resources still describe Business Analysis as if it belongs to the past, focusing more on theory than practice.

This is why this book matters. It is not just a handbook of techniques, nor a theoretical exploration. It is a practical guide — grounded in real projects, written with clarity, and structured for modern Agile and digital environments. It takes the reader from foundational principles through to the challenges and opportunities of Business Analysis in today's world, including the rise of AI.

Whether you are new to Business Analysis or a seasoned practitioner, this book will sharpen your thinking, deepen your toolkit, and most importantly, help you deliver value. That, after all, is the essence of practical business analysis.
