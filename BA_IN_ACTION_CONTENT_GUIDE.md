## What Makes a "BA Doing Work" Section Good?

✅ **Real artifacts:** Emails, Jira tickets, meeting transcripts, documents  
✅ **Visual mockups:** UI screenshots, dashboards, workflow diagrams  
✅ **Specific examples:** Not generic - tied to CI&F project  
✅ **Show progression:** BA receives → BA analyzes → BA creates  
✅ **Tasks for user:** Let them practice doing the same work  

❌ **Avoid:** Just theory, generic advice, no artifacts, too short

**Next Steps:**
User should tell us which specific page(s) they can't see the BA work, and we'll enhance those pages with more artifacts and visual examples.
